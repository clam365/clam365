ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Chris Lam and welcome to my Github page! ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer in Greater Boston, Massachusetts, specializing in frontend and UI/UX development. Since owning a laptop for the first time when I was a little kid, I have always been fascinated with the world of design and art, constantly drawing things that I love such as clone troopers from Star Wars, and manipulating online tools like Photoshop.

During my sophomore year of college, I took on the role of lead frontend developer for my Software Engineering team. This opportunity allowed me to spearhead the UI design for an entire project, which ignited my passion for user interface design. This experience highlighted the critical role of UI in our modern world. My dream and goal are to improve designs holistically, focusing on emotion, functionality, and aesthetics.

I also like to olympic weightlift, watch anime, and go on adventures!
