ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Chris Lam and welcome to my Github page! ðŸ‘‹ I am an undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying computer science and data science.
On this page you will find my personal and class projects. Join my journey as I develop myself and look torwards the future!

My passion for computer science started when I was in middle school and I was introduced to WPI's TouchTomorrow, which showcases students' and companies' technologies. From that
moment on, I've continued to build my CS skills in languages and concepts. I am actively looking towards projects focused on AI, object detection, and visualization, with my latest project
implementing the Yolov5 algorithm for object detection. 

Feel free to look around and keep in touch with me on my personal website!
